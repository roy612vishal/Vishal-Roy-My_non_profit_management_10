# Simple Non-Profit Project Manager

## Project Overview

This project is a web application designed to serve as a simplified project management solution specifically for small non-profit organizations. Many small non-profits find existing tools too complex or expensive for their needs. This application aims to provide an accessible, user-friendly alternative focusing on core functionalities essential for managing projects, volunteers, and resources effectively.

This project is being developed as part of the **Project: Software Engineering (DLMCSPSE01)** course at **IU International University of Applied Sciences**.

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.8+ installed

    venv\Scripts\activate
    # macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Note: You will need to create a requirements.txt file using:
    # pip freeze > requirements.txt
    # Do this after installing Django and any other packages.
